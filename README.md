Weather : Raining<br>
</h2>
<h1 text-align="center">Raining day(1)</h1>
<hr />
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;text-align:left;color:gray">
For most people, the rain may be a very good weather, suitable for quietly listening to the rain in the room, or pick up a book savor, or in the bed to sleep quietly,
But for me, rainy days are dull.<br>
Muffled air, damp floors, and dim dorms, all filled with silence. And it is nothing to do in the weekend, I was more aware of the soul from the depths of the bored,
It is so I had to recall the rain that ten years ago, that I accidentally fell off the bike in the rain, that face is hurt to go home me. If time can come again, I will not again
So that their injuries, no rain in the desperate cry, there will not be that after the fall of the face is a scar of me, but will not let me feel the rain in life, is wet of my young and fit soul,
Yeah, the rain in life, maybe at that time, began with my journey between.<br>
After that time, I met numerous rainy days, life with the arrival of rain becomes dizzy, lifeless. Most of the characteristics of people suffered the experience, and I will be with rain,
Step by step forward, although the road will be more bumpy, I still have no reason to stop myself.That may be the exact reason why I build
this website, just finding a way to turly express myself, together with everything I suffer, including the rain.<br>
Still it's raining, but I can't stop my steps, keeping moving, is the main reason everything being achieved.<br>
